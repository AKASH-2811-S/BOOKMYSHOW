Some features of Spring Boot that make it so simple:

Inversion of control (IoC)
Dependency injection (DI)
Relying on Spring MVC to handle requests from HTTP servers
Spring Boot auto-configuration that doesnâ€™t require manual configuration
Building REST API services
Command-line interface (CLI)
It is an easy approach to building microservices that can run alongside each other without interfering with their functionality
